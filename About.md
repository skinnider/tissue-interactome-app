The mouse tissue interactome explorer is a project of the [Foster](https://fosterlab.msl.ubc.ca/) and [Gsponer](www.msl.ubc.ca/faculty/gsponer) laboratories at the University of British Columbia. 

The interactive web application allows users to explore interactome profiles of seven mouse tissues obtained by PCP-SILAM. Users can specify up to ten proteins for which to plot size exclusion chromatography (SEC) elution profiles across all seven tissues.

A preprint describing the study in depth can be accessed on [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/06/20/351247).

The data underlying the study is available for download at several levels of analysis. Raw proteomic data can be downloaded from the PRIDE repository under the accessions [PXD007288](proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/dataset/PXD007288) and [PXD022309](proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/dataset/PXD022309). Processed chromatograms, such as those plotted here, can also be downloaded from the BioStudies database under the accession [S-BSST152](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biostudies/studies/S-BSST152). Finally, inferred protein-protein interaction networks for each tissue can also be downloaded from [BioStudies](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biostudies/studies/S-BSST152).
